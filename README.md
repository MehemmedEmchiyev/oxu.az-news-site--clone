## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Note

The version of this project deployed on Vercel may contain news articles that do not resemble real news. This is because the backend is intended to be used as a learning task for students to practice API concepts, meaning they might add test data that doesn't reflect real-world news. We apologize for any visual discrepancies.
